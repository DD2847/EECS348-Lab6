Well this was a fun one.
I'm not sure how else I was supposed to make this without adding a user interface to actually execute the desired functions at will.
So, enjoy.

A few notes:
  1. Yes, I see that the input file is always going to be called "matrix_input.txt". I still added a fun intro to type that in. Be sure to include the file extension and make sure the file is in the same directory as the a.out or whatever you name the executable.
  2. We haven't gone over tries and catches or whatever they're called in C++. There is a bit of error correction but you may find it annoying to test too much. I am assuming good input.
  3. I am also assuming you will be testing this in the same Linux enviroment where it was created.
